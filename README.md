COP 3223 Study Group Answers
============================

This Github repository has the answers to the coding questions on each 
week's worksheet. In order of each week, we covered the following 
topics:

1. Arrays
2. 2D arrays
3. Strings
4. Functions by value

Each problem solution is either in `answers.txt` or `answers.c` in the 
appropriate folder. For the first three sections however, the
coding problem solutions are split up into separate files like `two.c` 
and `three.c` since functions haven't been covered yet.
